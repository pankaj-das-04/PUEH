# PUEH
Implantable biomedical devices have revolutionized medical treatments, but their reliance on internal batteries poses challenges. Energy harvesting technologies aim to extend battery lifetimes and reduce patient interventions. Two main methods are heart vibration or triboelectric devices, which generate internal electrical charges and potential. However, these methods may not work for small organs or require external signals to vibrate the diaphragm.
Inductive power transfer (IPT) and acoustic power transfer are methods for energy transfer. IPT uses energy sources or transmitters, with alignment being crucial. However, efficiency decreases with distance and has potential side effects. Acoustic energy can transfer energy over long distances, but conventional bulk ultrasonic energy harvesters face limitations, especially in bandwidth due to acoustic impedance mismatches.<br/>
## Motivation of work
The project aims to overcome limitations of conventional implantable biomedical devices by developing a Piezoelectric Ultrasonic Energy Harvester (PUEH), which can enhance power efficiency, broadband property, and longevity while reducing healthcare burdens by harnessing external acoustic energy.<br/>
## Objective of work
This thesis aims to design and optimize a Piezoelectric Ultrasonic Energy Harvester (PUEH) for maximum power generation, utilizing Piezoelectric MEMS diaphragms for efficient frequency responses. The goal is to advance energy harvesting technologies for implantable biomedical devices.<br/>
